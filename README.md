Hi, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and (hopefully) the development of novel model architectures.
Currently a student at RTU MIREA 👨‍🎓, I'm expanding my expertise in MLOps to streamline the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models.

**Skills & Expertise:**

* **Programming Languages:** Python 🐍, R 📊, SQL 🗄️, Mojo 🚀
* **Machine Learning:** NLP (text classification, generation, etc.), Deep Learning (mention specific architectures if applicable, e.g., Transformers, RNNs), Model Optimization,  MLOps (CI/CD for ML, model monitoring, etc.)
* **Tools & Technologies:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch, different Meta NLP libraries, Docker, Hadoop (in progress)
* **Databases:**  PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Pinecone


**Experience:**

* Active participant in various hackathons, including RLT Hack, GPN Fast Track, Viribus Unitis, Rostelecom events, and Gorodskie Legendy.  🏆
